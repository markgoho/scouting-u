/**
 * Generates DRG guide images for one Scouts BSA rank via Gemini image
 * generation. Trimmed/adapted port of mbu/scripts/generate-drg-images.ts:
 * merit badge -> rank vocabulary, guide path -> scouts-bsa/ranks/{slug}/guide,
 * and the branding denylist updated to this site's own names ("Scouting
 * University", "Digital Requirements Guide") in place of mbu's.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   bun scripts/generate-drg-images.ts --rank <slug>
 *   bun scripts/generate-drg-images.ts --rank <slug> --index <N>
 *   bun scripts/generate-drg-images.ts --rank <slug> --id <image-id>

const RECURRING_CAST = `
RECURRING CAST — USE THESE SAME KIDS IN EVERY PHOTO:
When people appear in the scene, draw from this specific group of Scouts. They are the SAME kids across every image — treat this like a photo series following one Scout troop:

1. MAYA — 14-year-old girl, Black, tall and athletic build, natural hair in two puffs, confident posture, often takes the lead
2. ETHAN — 12-year-old boy, white/red hair and freckles, shorter and wiry, eager expression, carries a big backpack relative to his size
3. SOFIA — 15-year-old girl, Latina, medium build, long dark hair usually in a braid, calm and focused demeanor
4. JAMES — 13-year-old boy, East Asian, average height, glasses, curious expression, often examining things closely
5. KAI — 16-year-old boy, Pacific Islander/mixed-race, broad-shouldered and tallest of the group, relaxed and easygoing presence

Not every kid needs to appear in every photo — use whichever 2-5 of them make sense for the scene. But they must be RECOGNIZABLY the same individuals across images: same hair, same face, same build, same glasses (James), same freckles (Ethan), etc.

CAST PRIVACY RULE:
- These names and demographic descriptors are prompt-only casting guidance.
- NEVER render any cast name, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, or gender as visible text anywhere in the image.
- NEVER turn cast descriptors into labels, callouts, captions, badges, posters, watermarks, or annotations.
- If the image includes text annotations, they may label ONLY techniques, equipment, actions, directions, or safety concepts — never people.`;

const UNIFORM_SECTION = `
PROJECT BRANDING — STILL FORBIDDEN:
- NEVER render "Scouting University", "Scouting U", "Digital Requirements Guide", or any project branding as visible text in the image. No titles, headers, watermarks, or project branding of any kind. This is about this project's own site branding, not the Scout uniform itself.

UNIFORM & CLOTHING — FULL REALISM:
- Youth should frequently be wearing a realistic Scouts BSA field uniform: a tan/khaki button-up shirt with olive green pants/shorts.
- Include olive green shoulder loops on both shoulders — this is the color that marks the Scouts BSA program level (distinct from the colors used at other program levels).
- Include a rank patch on the left pocket, generic council/unit patches on the sleeves, and (for older-looking scenes) an optional merit-badge sash worn diagonally across the chest. The right pocket may carry the organization's wordmark in small red lettering, the way it appears on the real uniform. Invent generic council/unit numbers rather than depicting a specific real council or troop.
- When NOT in uniform, youth wear generic outdoor clothing in earth tones (greens, browns, khaki, navy).
- NO brand names or non-Scouting logos visible on clothing or gear.
- Scout uniforms must ALWAYS appear clean, neat, and presentable — no stains, paint, mud, tears, or visible wear.
- If the scene involves messy activities (painting, gardening, cooking), Scouts should be wearing generic work clothes or aprons OVER their uniforms, OR the uniforms should remain visibly clean and unaffected.
- The Scout uniform represents the organization and must never look damaged, dirty, or disrespected in any image.`;

const SAFETY_SECTION = `
SAFETY-CRITICAL ACCURACY:
- Any image depicting a safety practice, rule, or technique MUST be correct in every visible detail. A wrong detail in a safety image actively teaches dangerous behavior.
- Equipment must be shown used correctly: helmets level on the head with straps buckled, PFDs properly fitted, harnesses snug, eye protection worn.
- Containers, tools, and gear must look like what they are. A water container must NOT resemble a fuel or chemical container. A cooking flame must NOT appear near flammable liquids or inappropriate materials.
- Body positioning and technique must be accurate: proper lifting form, correct hand placement on tools, safe distances from hazards.
- If the scene involves fire, stoves, or heat sources, ensure all nearby objects are plausible and safe — no red gas cans, aerosol cans, or plastic containers near open flame.
- When in doubt, depict the SAFEST version of the scene. Err on the side of caution.`;

const NO_BRANDING_SECTION = `
ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN — BRANDING AND ORGANIZATIONAL TEXT:
- NEVER render the words "Scouting America", "Boy Scouts of America", "BSA", "Scouting University", "Scouting U", or "Digital Requirements Guide" as visible text anywhere in the image.
- Do NOT render any organizational logos, emblems, insignia, titles, headers, watermarks, or branding.
- The image should contain ONLY educational content — no project or organizational identity.`;

const TEXT_DENSITY_SECTION = `
TEXT DENSITY — KEEP TEXT MINIMAL:
- The image should be VISUAL-FIRST. Text should occupy no more than ~20% of the image area.
- Use short single-word or brief-phrase labels only. No sentences, paragraphs, or dense text blocks.
- If the concept requires a lot of text to explain, that text belongs on the web page, not in the image.
- The image generator produces illegible text at small sizes — fewer labels at larger size is always better than many labels at small size.
- Prefer icons, visual symbols, and spatial layout to communicate meaning instead of text.`;

- Do NOT generate illustrations, drawings, paintings, watercolors, sketches, cartoons, digital art, or any non-photographic style
- Even if the description mentions "illustration" or "painting", IGNORE that and produce a photorealistic photograph instead
- Think: National Geographic photo, DSLR camera, real-world scene captured on film
${RECURRING_CAST}

STYLE REQUIREMENTS:
- Photorealistic photography style with warm, natural lighting

- Clean composition suitable for all ages (youth 11-17)
- NO text overlays, watermarks, or captions in the image
- NO organizational names, logos, or branding visible anywhere — see ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN section above

- Labels should have semi-transparent backgrounds for readability
- Arrows should be clean and clearly point to their subjects
- Think: annotated textbook photo, museum exhibit label, instructional manual

ANNOTATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Labels must be LEGIBLE at web resolution
- Use a consistent label style throughout (same font, same background treatment)
- Arrows or leader lines should be clean and clearly connect labels to subjects
- Semi-transparent label backgrounds (white or light color at ~80% opacity)
- Dark text on light labels for maximum readability
- Place labels to minimize overlap with important visual content

PHOTOGRAPHY BASE:
- Warm, natural lighting
- Clean composition suitable for youth ages 11-17

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS:

- Use color coding to group related information
- Do NOT include a title, heading, or banner at the top — the web page provides its own heading
- Keep text to short labels and key numbers only — no sentences or paragraphs

TYPOGRAPHY:
- Labels: large, bold, legible at web resolution
- Key numbers/facts: large and highlighted
- No body text or paragraphs — if it needs that much text, it belongs on the web page, not in the image

- Style: somewhere between a botanical illustration and an engineering diagram
- Professional, educational, authoritative feel

ILLUSTRATION REQUIREMENTS:
- Clean white or light neutral background
- Precise, detailed rendering of the subject
- Only add labels if the description explicitly asks for them — otherwise let the visual speak for itself
- Consistent line weight and rendering style
- Cross-hatching or subtle shading for depth (not photorealistic shading)
- Color should be accurate and educational, not decorative

SCENE: `;

- Use a split-frame, side-by-side, or before/after layout
- Clearly label each side (e.g., "CORRECT" vs "INCORRECT", "DO" vs "DON'T", "BEFORE" vs "AFTER")
- The comparison should be immediately obvious and educational

COMPARISON REQUIREMENTS:
- Both sides should show the SAME subject or scenario
- Differences must be clearly visible and meaningful
- Labels must be large and legible at web resolution

- A dividing line or visual separator between the two sides
- Can be photorealistic or illustrated — whichever communicates the comparison more clearly
